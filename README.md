## Why?
I am a perfectionist and obsessed with detail, which severely limits my productivity. Thus I decided to create a blog that is so simple that I can't possibly spend too much time on it.

## Features:

- No JavaScript, extremely lightweight.
- MDX for writing posts.
- Dark & light theme.

## Project Structure:

- src
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    library
  - index.astro
  - library.astro
