# Gargamel
The blog where every byte matters - an exercise in digital minimalism.

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/Miyli/Gargamel)

## Why?
I am a perfectionist and obsessed with detail, which severely limits my productivity. Thus I decided to create a blog that is so simple that I can't possibly spend too much time on it.

## Using it for yourself:

Currently I use the repo to store my own writings/ramblings, to use this for yourself, you have to:
1. Change the index.astro to your own introduction.
2. Empty out /library and put in your posts.

## Features:

- No JavaScript, extremely lightweight.
- MDX for writing posts.
- Dark & light theme.

## Project Structure:

- src
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    library
  - index.astro
  - library.astro
